# ids.server: Server part of ICAT Data Server (IDS)

## Linting
The [spotless-maven-plugin](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.diffplug.spotless/spotless-maven-plugin) is used here for linting. It uses the Eclipse code formatting feature. The guidelines are defined in `.spotless/eclipse-formatter.xml` which was initially exported from eclipse (so you can do it again: define rules in eclipse an export the file to use it here).

By default, code checks are disabled for local builds, but enforced in the CI build pipeline.
You also can execute the commands manually:
* `mvn spotless:check -Dspotless.check.skip=false` to validate the source files,
* `mvn spotless:apply` to directly change the source files according to the linting.

### Import order
The import order is also validated and applied by the spotless-maven-plugin. It is defined in the file `.spotless/eclipse-importorder.txt` and referenced in `pom.xml`. It is needed that it has a compatible format like the eclipse built-in import order configuration (better its exported file).
