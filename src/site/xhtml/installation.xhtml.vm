    <title>IDS Installation</title>
</head>
<body>


<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>This will work with an ICAT version of 4.3.0 or greater and
    requires plugins implementing the IDS plugin interface 1.5.0.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The ids distribution: <a
            href="${repoUrl}/org/icatproject/ids.server/${project.version}/ids.server-${project.version}-distro.zip">ids.server-${project.version}
        -distro.zip</a>
    </li>

    <li>A suitable deployed container to support a web application.
        Testing has been carried out with Payara41 and Glassfish 4.0.<a
                href="http://icatproject.org/installation/glassfish/">Glassfish
            (payara) installation instructions</a> are available.
    </li>

    <li>A deployed plugin or plugins for the storage mechanism you
        wish to use. Please see <a href="/site/ids/plugin">plugin</a> to see
        the interface you must implement. You might also like to look at the
        <a href="/site/ids/storage_file">file storage plugin</a> as an
        example.
    </li>

    <li>Python (version 2.4 to 2.7) installed on the server.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary of steps</h2>


<ol>
    <li>Please follow <a
            href="http://icatproject.org/installation/component/"> the
        generic installation instructions</a>
    </li>

    <li>Check that it works.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The setup.properties file</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>container</dt>
    <dd>
        Values must be chosen from: <a target="_blank"
                                       href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/api/2.6/org/eclipse/persistence/config/TargetServer.html">TargetServer</a>
        Though only Glassfish is working properly at the moment.
    </dd>
    <dt>home</dt>
    <dd>is the top level of the container installation. For
        glasssfish it must contain "glassfish/domains" and for wildfly it
        must contain jboss-modules.jar.
    </dd>
    <dt>port</dt>
    <dd>is the administration port of the container which is
        typically 4848 for glassfish and 9990 for wildfly.
    </dd>
    <dt>secure</dt>
    <dd>must be set to true or false. If true then only https and not
        http connections will be allowed.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2>The run.properties file</h2>

All the property values are passed to the plugin(s). A plugin is only
expected to look at properties defined for its use. It is recommended
that such properties have names starting
<code>plugin.main.</code>
or
<code>plugin.archive</code>
. to make sure that they don't clash with any current or future
run.properties of the ids.server. To find the names of these properties
please consult the documentation for your plugin(s).

<h3>General Properties</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>icat.url</dt>
    <dd>
        The url of the machine hosting the icat service. It should normally
        just have the scheme, the hostname and the port. For example:
        <code>https://example.com:443</code>
    </dd>

    <dt>plugin.zipMapper.class</dt>
    <dd>The class name of the ZipMapper which defines the Zip file
        structure you want. The class must be deployed in the lib/applibs
        directory of your domain and must be packaged with all it
        dependencies.
    </dd>

    <dt>plugin.main.class</dt>
    <dd>The class name of the main storage plugin. The class must be
        deployed in the lib/applibs directory of your domain and must be
        packaged with all it dependencies.
    </dd>

    <dt>cache.dir</dt>
    <dd>The location (absolute or relative to the config directory of
        the domain) of a directory to hold mostly zip files.
    </dd>

    <dt>preparedCount</dt>
    <dd>The number of preparedId values from prepareData calls to
        remember.
    </dd>

    <dt>processQueueIntervalSeconds</dt>
    <dd>The frequency of checking the process queue. This is used
        both for cleaning old information from memory and for triggering
        movements between main and archive storage (if selected).
    </dd>

    <dt>rootUserNames</dt>
    <dd>A space separated list of users allowed to make the
        getServiceStatus call. The user name must include the mechanism if
        the authenticators have been configured that way.
    </dd>

    <dt>sizeCheckIntervalSeconds</dt>
    <dd>How frequently to check the cache sizes and clean up if
        necessary.
    </dd>

    <dt>readOnly</dt>
    <dd>If true disables write operations (put and delete).</dd>

    <dt>linkLifetimeSeconds</dt>
    <dd>Optional, default zero. The length of time in seconds to keep the links
        established by the getLink call. If this is set to zero then the getLink
        call is disabled.
        <p><strong>Deprecated:</strong> the getLink call is deprecated
            and slated for removal along with this property in
            ids.server 3.0.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>reader</dt>
    <dd>
        Space separated icat plugin name and credentials for a user permitted
        to read all datasets, datafiles, investigations and facilities. For
        example:
        <code>db username root password secret.</code>
    </dd>

    <dt>key</dt>
    <dd>Optional key value. If specified this contributes to the
        computation of a cryptographic hash added to the location value in
        the database. The ids plugins do not see the hash. The key must of
        course be long enough to be secure and must be kept private.
    </dd>

    <dt>maxIdsInQuery</dt>
    <dd>The number of literal id values to be generated in an ICAT
        query. For Oracle this must not exceed 1000.
    </dd>

    <dt>log.list</dt>
    <dd>Optional. If present it specifies a set of call types to log
        via JMS calls. The types are specified by a space separated list of
        values taken from READ, WRITE, LINK, MIGRATE, PREPARE and INFO.
    </dd>

    <dt>jms.topicConnectionFactory</dt>
    <dd>Optional. If present it overrides the default JMS connection
        factory.
    </dd>

    <dt>logback.xml</dt>
    <dd>This is optional. If present it must specify the path to a
        logback.xml file. The path may be absolute or relative to the config
        directory. The file ids.logback.xml.example may be renamed to
        ids.logback.xml to get started.
    </dd>

    <dt>useReaderForPerformance</dt>
    <dd>Optional. If true allows the IDS to make use of the reader account
        to improve query performance. Note that this bypasses some
        access permission checks. It essentially has the effect of
        allowing any user access to datafiles if that user has access
        permission to the dataset the datafiles belong to. This is
        similar to an implicit PublicStep from Dataset to Datafile. Do
        not set this flag unless you would be happy to also create this
        PublicStep in your ICAT!
    </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Properties for archive storage</h3>
<p>If you are not using archive storage then all of these
    properties should be omitted.</p>
<dl>

    <dt>plugin.archive.class</dt>
    <dd>The class name of the archive storage plugin. The class must
        be deployed in the lib/applibs directory of your domain and must be
        packaged with all it dependencies.
    </dd>

    <dt>delayDatasetWritesSeconds</dt>
    <dd>The amount of time to wait before writing a dataset archive storage.
        This exists to allow enough time for all the datafiles to be added to
        a dataset before it is zipped and written. This property is only
        used if storageUnit is set to dataset, see below.
    </dd>

    <dt>delayDatafileOperationsSeconds</dt>
    <dd>The amount of time to wait before processing any deferred operations for
        datafiles. Operations are collected during this period of time and
        processed at once in combined threads. This property is only
        used if storageUnit is set to datafile, see below.
    </dd>

    <dt>startArchivingLevel1024bytes</dt>
    <dd>If the space used in main storage exceeds this then datasets
        will be archived (oldest first) until the space used is below
        stopArchivingLevel1024bytes.
    </dd>

    <dt>stopArchivingLevel1024bytes</dt>
    <dd>See startArchivingLevel1024bytes.</dd>

    <dt>storageUnit</dt>
    <dd>May be dataset or datafile and is not case sensitive. A value
        of "dataset" means that a whole dataset of files are zipped up to be
        stored as a single file whereas "datafile" causes datafiles to be
        stored individually.
    </dd>

    <dt>tidyBlockSize</dt>
    <dd>The number of datafiles or datasets to get back in one call
        for archive request when space on main storage is low.
    </dd>

    <dt>enableWrite</dt>
    <dd>Optional. If true, the write call will be enabled, if false, it will be
        disabled. If not set, the readOnly flag will take control and the
        write call will be disabled if readOnly is true and enabled if
        not.
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Check that the ids server works</h2>
<p>
    Enter a url of the form
    <code>https://example.com:443/ids/ping</code>
    into a web browse and it should respond:
    <code>IdsOK</code>
    . Note the url is that of the machine hosting the IDS followed by
    "/ids/ping"
</p>
